<p><strong>The Doxercalciferol Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SHPT in patients with CKD on dialysis</li><li>SHPT in patients with stage 3 or stage 4 CKD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Doxercalciferol is a vitamin D analog used to manage secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In those on dialysis, it helps regulate parathyroid hormone levels, reducing bone disease risks. Similarly, in patients with stage 3 or stage 4 CKD, doxercalciferol aids in managing SHPT by improving calcium and phosphate balance, ultimately enhancing overall mineral metabolism and mitigating complications associated with CKD, thereby improving patient outcomes and quality of life.</p></p>
